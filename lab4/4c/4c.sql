/* ------ Question 8 ------ */
/* a) How can you protect the credit card information in the database from hackers?

Answer: There are multiple ways you can protect that information, first of you could limit the access by assigning special access privileges.
You could also encrypt the information or use hashing on sensitive and vulnerable credit card data.


b) Give three advantages of using stored procedures in the database (and thereby
execute them on the server) instead of writing the same functions in the
frontend of the system (in for example JavaScript on a Web page)?

Answer: 
1. The procedure calls are quick and efficient since they are only stored and compiled once.
The executable code is also automatically cached, therefore it will lower the memory requirements.

2. Updating a stored procedure in the database automatically will apply changes to all applications using it.
Which will lead to avoiding the need to redeploy front-end code.

3. One statement can trigger several statements inside the procedure which results in more efficient queries.

/* ------ Question 9 ------ */
/*
a) In session A, add a new reservation.
b) Is this reservation visible in session B? Why? Why not?

Answer:
Since we started a transaction, changes are not visible in the second terminal window that is session B, because each session is locked.
We need to first commit the transaction to make the changes visible and update the database.


c) What happens if you try to modify the reservation from A in B? Explain what
happens and why this happens and how this relates to the concept of isolation
of transactions.

Answer:
We can't perform actions in window B due to the active transaction in window A,
since session B is waiting for session A to commit.
We tried to delete the reservation from session B, but nothing happened for a while and then
ERROR 1205 (HY000): Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction, occured.
We then performed commit from session A, and session B could thereafter modify the reservation by deleting the last one added.

/* ------ Question 10 ------ */
/*
a) Did overbooking occur when the scripts were executed? If so, why? If not, why not?

Answer:


b) Can an overbooking theoretically occur? If an overbooking is possible,
in what order must the lines of code in your procedures/functions be executed.

Answer:


c) Try to make the theoretical case occur in reality by simulating that multiple sessions call the procedure at the same time.
To specify the order in which the lines of code are executed use the MySQL query SELECT sleep(5);
which makes the session sleep for 5 seconds.
Note that it is not always possible to make the theoretical case occur, if not, motivate why.

Answer:


d)
